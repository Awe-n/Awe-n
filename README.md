### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a Cybersecurity student pursuing a double master's degree at **EPFL/ETH**, I work part-time at **Strong Network** as a Security and Market Researcher.

In addition to this, I am currently developing **my own e-commerce website called AKPA**, which will be released soon. 
Furthermore, I am also a **co-founder of Filos**, an AI-productivity based Startup incubated in both San Diego and Lausanne.

Follow me on my socials if you desire to stay updated on my projects (& more) ðŸ˜„
